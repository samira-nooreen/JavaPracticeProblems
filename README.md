Q1) Chef and Instant Noodles
Chef has invented 
1-minute Instant Noodles. As the name suggests, each packet takes exactly 
1 minute to cook.
Chef's restaurant has 
𝑋
X stoves and only 1 packet can be cooked in a single stove at any minute.
How many customers can Chef serve in 𝑌 minutes if each customer orders exactly 1 packet of noodles?
Ans) 2 3
      6
Chef and Brain Speed
In ChefLand, human brain speed is measured in bits per second (bps). Chef has a threshold limit of 
𝑋
X bits per second above which his calculations are prone to errors. If Chef is currently working at 
𝑌
Y bits per second, is he prone to errors?

If Chef is prone to errors print YES, otherwise print NO.

Input Format
The only line of input contains two space separated integers 
𝑋
X and 
𝑌
Y — the threshold limit and the rate at which Chef is currently working at.

Output Format
If Chef is prone to errors print YES, otherwise print NO.

You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings yes, Yes, yEs, and YES will all be treated as identical).

Q3)Alice and Marks
Alice has scored 
𝑋
X marks in her test and Bob has scored 
𝑌
Y marks in the same test. Alice is happy if she scored at least twice the marks of Bob’s score. Determine whether she is happy or not.

Input Format
The first and only line of input contains two space-separated integers 
𝑋
,
𝑌
X,Y — the marks of Alice and Bob respectively.
Output Format
For each testcase, print Yes if Alice is happy and No if she is not, according to the problem statement.

The judge is case insensitive so you may output the answer in any case. In particular YES, yes, yEsare all considered equivalent toYes`.

Q4)Oneful Pairs
Chef defines a pair of positive integers 
(
𝑎
,
𝑏
)
(a,b) to be a 
Oneful Pair
Oneful Pair, if

𝑎
+
𝑏
+
(
𝑎
⋅
𝑏
)
=
111
a+b+(a⋅b)=111

For example, 
(
1
,
55
)
(1,55) is a 
Oneful Pair
Oneful Pair, since 
1
+
55
+
(
1
⋅
55
)
=
56
+
55
=
111
1+55+(1⋅55)=56+55=111.
But 
(
1
,
56
)
(1,56) is not a 
Oneful Pair
Oneful Pair, since 
1
+
56
+
(
1

)
=
57
+
56
=

≠
111
1+56+(1⋅56)=57+56=113=111.

Given two positive integers 
𝑎
a and 
𝑏
b, output Yes if they are a 
Oneful Pair
Oneful Pair. And No otherwise.

Input Format
The only line of input contains two space-separated integers 
𝑎
a and 
𝑏
b.

Output Format
Output Yes, if 
(
𝑎
,
𝑏
)
(a,b) form a 
Oneful Pair
Oneful Pair. Output No if they do not.

You may print each character of Yes and No in uppercase or lowercase (for example, yes, yEs, Yes will be considered identical).

Q5)Add Two Numbers
Your task is very simple: given two integers 
𝐴
A and 
𝐵
B, write a program to add these two numbers and output the sum.

Input Format
The first line contains an integer 
𝑇
T, the total number of test cases.
Then follow 
𝑇
T lines, each line contains two integers, 
𝐴
A and 
𝐵
B.
Output Format
For each test case, add 
𝐴
A and 
𝐵
B and display the sum in a new line.

Q6)Good Turn
Chef and Chefina are playing with dice. In one turn, both of them roll their dice at once.

They consider a turn to be good if the sum of the numbers on their dice is greater than 
6
6.
Given that in a particular turn Chef and Chefina got 
𝑋
X and 
𝑌
Y on their respective dice, find whether the turn was good.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer 
𝑇
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case contains two space-separated integers 
𝑋
X and 
𝑌
Y — the numbers Chef and Chefina got on their respective dice.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, YES, if the turn was good and NO otherwise.

Each character of the output may be printed in either uppercase or lowercase. That is, the strings NO, no, nO, and No will be treated as equivalent.
